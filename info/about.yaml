    short: >
        "I am a Postdoc at Argonne National Laboratory in the
        Mathematics and Computer Science (MCS) Division.
        I received my Ph.D. in Computer Science from Virginia Tech in 2020,
        where my thesis was Mathematical Software for Multiobjective
        Optimization Problems."

        "My current research interests include optimization,
        approximation theory, computational geometry, algorithms,
        and parallel computing, for applications in scientific computing,
        data science, and engineering.

        Some specific examples of my work include:

          - multiobjective optimization of computationally expensive blackbox simulations; 
          - efficiently computing Delaunay Triangulations in medium to high dimensions;
          - Interpolation of high-dimensional blackbox functions; and
          - producing high quality, portable Mathematical Software
            (both serial and parallel).

        I am particularly passionate about producing open-source scientific
        software.
        Check out some of my Software below or on my GitHub, and don't
        hesitate to reach out if you have questions, comments, or feedback!
